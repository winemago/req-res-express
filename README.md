# web app:    Node-Express-Nedb
Own server with express.js, that host static HTML files, send the info with a POST, print image taken on a map, and, on a specific location. The server receive the POST request and save it on data base, then, it send back all that data as a response finishing up the request.
In the main page I ask for a GET request to the server to draw al the users from database on the map.
